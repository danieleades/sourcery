# Aggregates

An **aggregate** is a cluster of domain objects treated as a single unit for data changes. In event sourcing, aggregates rebuild their state by replaying events and validate commands to produce new events.

## The `Aggregate` Trait

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../sourcery-core/src/aggregate.rs:aggregate_trait}}
```

The `#[derive(Aggregate)]` macro generates most of this—you implement `Apply<E>` for each event and `Handle<C>` for each command.

## Snapshots and `serde`

Snapshots are opt-in. If you enable snapshots (via `Repository::with_snapshots`), the aggregate state must be serializable (`Serialize + DeserializeOwned`).

## The `Apply<E>` Trait

When using `#[derive(Aggregate)]`, implement `Apply<E>` for each event type:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../sourcery-core/src/aggregate.rs:apply_trait}}
```

This is where state mutation happens:

```rust,ignore
impl Apply<FundsDeposited> for Account {
    fn apply(&mut self, event: &FundsDeposited) {
        self.balance += event.amount;
    }
}

impl Apply<FundsWithdrawn> for Account {
    fn apply(&mut self, event: &FundsWithdrawn) {
        self.balance -= event.amount;
    }
}
```

**Key rules:** `apply` must be infallible (events are facts) and deterministic (same events → same state).

## Event Replay

```d2
shape: sequence_diagram

Store: Event Store
Agg: Account (Default)

Agg: "balance = 0" {shape: text}
Store -> Agg: "apply(FundsDeposited { amount: 100 })"
Agg: "balance = 100" {shape: text}
Store -> Agg: "apply(FundsWithdrawn { amount: 30 })"
Agg: "balance = 70" {shape: text}
Store -> Agg: "apply(FundsDeposited { amount: 50 })"
Agg: "balance = 120" {shape: text}
```

The aggregate starts in its `Default` state. Each event is applied in order. The final state matches what would exist if you had executed all the original commands.

## Loading Aggregates

Use `AggregateBuilder` to load an aggregate's current state:

```rust,ignore
let account: Account = repository
    .aggregate_builder()
    .load(&account_id)
    .await?;

println!("Current balance: {}", account.balance);
```

On `Repository` this replays all events for that aggregate ID.
On `Repository<S, C, Snapshots<SS>>` it loads a snapshot first (when present) and replays only the delta.
