# Licensing

These licensing terms apply to all source code in this repository.

This project is available under two licensing options:

## Option 1: GNU General Public License v3.0 (Default)

**When to use:** Open source projects, research, education, or any project where you're comfortable with copyleft requirements.

**Key requirements:**

- You can use, modify, and distribute this software freely
- Any software that incorporates Sourcery must also be licensed under GPL v3
- You must provide source code to users of your software
- See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for full terms

**This is the default licence** - if you're using Sourcery without a separate commercial agreement, you're using it under GPL v3.

## Option 2: Commercial License

**When to use:** Proprietary software, commercial products, or any situation where GPL v3's copyleft requirements are incompatible with your needs.

**What it provides:**

- Permission to use Sourcery in proprietary/closed-source software
- No requirement to license your software under GPL v3
- No obligation to provide source code to your users

**To obtain a commercial licence:**

- Contact: <danieleades@hotmail.com>
- Include: Brief description of your intended use case
- Commercial licensing terms are negotiated on a case-by-case basis
- Commercial licences are typically free or priced nominally for individuals and small teams
- For well-funded organisations, we may request a very modest fee to support ongoing maintenance
- We may ask a few follow-up questions; in rare cases we may decline a commercial licensing request

## How to Choose

**Use GPL v3 if:**

- Your project is open source
- You're doing academic research
- You're comfortable making your code available under GPL v3
- You're just experimenting or learning
- You're evaluating Sourcery privately without distributing it

**Contact us for commercial licensing if:**

- You're building a proprietary product
- You can't or don't want to release your source code
- You need to distribute Sourcery as part of closed-source software
- You're unsure about GPL v3 compatibility with your project
