//! Compile-time concurrency strategy selection.
//!
//! This module provides marker types for choosing between optimistic
//! (version-checked) and unchecked (last-writer-wins) concurrency control at
//! the type level.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // Default: optimistic concurrency (safe)
//! let repo = Repository::new(store);
//!
//! // Opt-out for single-writer scenarios
//! let repo = Repository::new(store).without_concurrency_checking();
//! ```

use thiserror::Error;

/// No version checking - last writer wins.
///
/// Events are appended without checking whether other events were added
/// since loading. Suitable for single-writer scenarios or when conflicts
/// are acceptable.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Default)]
pub struct Unchecked;

/// Optimistic concurrency control - version checked on every write.
///
/// This is the default concurrency strategy for
/// [`Repository`](crate::repository::Repository). With this strategy, the
/// repository tracks the stream version when loading an aggregate and verifies
/// it hasn't changed before appending new events. If the version changed
/// (another writer appended events), the operation fails with a
/// [`ConcurrencyConflict`] error.
